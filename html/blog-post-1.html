                        A poem about my last painting that I would like to share with anyone else who is suffering a similar circumstance.
                        I pray God hears our prayers and blesses each one of use with healthy, happy pregnancies; and beautiful, healthy babies, that grow into amazing loving people.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "How many hours and how many more days?
                        These jolting emotions too much.
                        I sit here and ponder when my flower will bloom.
                        Motherhood so far from my grasp even though dreamt of since I could walk.
                        Memories of me and my dolls flash my mind and I sit there further in fret and dismay.. oh the pain! It's too much!! So I cry.
                        I then look below me and observe what I'm on and it's no flower about to bloom in the day, but a dead one who's already seen it's last one in the sun.
                        I take it as a sign and believe for a bit that all hope is gone and my womb is dead too.
                        So depressing I ponder this just can not be.
                        Then as I try to fix things myself and paint this dead thing a proper flower bud something sparks in my mind, that this is no mistake of mine.
                        The lord knew and did it on purpose.
                        This thing I sit on is the carrier of seed.
                        The future of millions of generations to come!!!
                        Given some water and nurture and love.
                        I run outside to see for myself the dead poppy outside the front door.
                        That this very bud I sit on is the one full of life!!
                        I hold it and tip it and seeds come pouring out!!
                        I realize and believe that one day I too will be a mother and with no evidence now those tiny seeds like my own will become my future 
                        and I'll look back on these days with a grin so for now I will sit here and smile above and be thankful for all the blessings to come!"
