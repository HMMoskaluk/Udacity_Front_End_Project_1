                        <p>
                            So amazing, So I started a painting of a woman sitting on a poppy bud and I wanted it to be symbolic of her not being in her season yet and will bloom in time.
                            But the buds not yet bloomed are all floppy and there wouldn't be room for her to sit on it without it looking funny.
                            So instead I put her on a dead poppy flower that is more up right and would have a place to sit on.
                            I was bothered that it was a "dead flower" though.
                            After I started these flower painting a friend had given me poppy flowers as a gift and I planted them in the front yard.
                            Anyway, the painting was about processing my lack of being pregnant and having kids now, I was distressed that my period has just come again and I wasn't pregnant.
                            I wanted to change it and put her on a flower that was about to bloom but while attempting to do this, holy spirit showed me something the "dead" flower she's sitting on is one with seeds in it!
                            Symbolic of the eggs in my womb. I realized this and went out to pick a dead flower to see for myself.
                            Sure enough seeds started falling out of this flower bud and they kept pouring and pouring out in abundance so the napkin was black.
                            To me this was the Lords way of saying my womb will one day be opened and I will have my children. 
                            My womb is ready this experience nearly brought me to tears and I was so thankful to God!!
