                <h1>"Recieve" Painting</h1>
                <h4>May 15, 2019</h4>
                <h3>By: Noelle Perry Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        So the lord gave me a picture to paint of cascading waterfalls.
                        Shortly after this Isaac and I saw waterfalls exactly like it in my vision at Zion National Park!
                        Shortly after starting the painting about overcoming rejection god clearly spoke "recieve" what I have for you!
                        I was perplexed because he told me this so soon and I didnt hear much for the next 50+ hours of working on it.
                        The day I basically finished this painting I also won a local art contest at the mall.
                        Which I felt was God pouring out his blessing and abundance on me it was the "surround" painting that won and now is displayed at the mall!
                        At first I wanted to use the prize money on shoes I needed for my foot injury but I felt the lord wanted me to recieve so I found a cute store
                        that makes my heart happy.
                        I created this painting to serve in the processing of emotion and to help me understand what solutions were available from the Lord. 
                        He showed me all I needed to overcome was to reject what the world had given and receive in it's place what He has for me, acceptance, understanding and acknowledgment was what I needed, 
                        but is only a small bit bit of all that there is available for each of us. Receiving, however, was much easier said then done and I was at a little bit of a loss in knowing how.
                        I learned the answer symbolically as I painted. 
                        Attempting at times to paint in my own strength or knowledge resulted in "mistakes" having to be repaired. 
                        So much frustration amounted from this and I wasn't sure if I would finish it. It wasn't until I stopped and waited, literally not painting a stroke, that I was able to receive what the Lord had.
                        It was in those weeks of the painting being hidden away that the Lord gave me direction for it. 
                        He showed me the painting needed more from above, cascading light/falls, symbolic of all there is for us to receive. 
                        when I began it was surreal as though my strokes were not my own. 
                        Before there was only one waterfall the woman was receiving from and afterwords the whole painting had transformed having so many areas available. 
                        The Lord showed me that all we need to do is simply ask, wait, listen, and reach out our hands to receive.
                        I created a short YouTube slideshow/video to show some of the parts of frustration during the creation of "Receive" if you'd like to see. 
                        Notice the wings that came and went several times and some bold strokes of mist that I put in then took out.
