                <h1>"Seed of Life"</h1>
                <h2>May 27, 2019</h2>
                <h3>By: Noelle Perry Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        A poem about my last painting that I would like to share with anyone else who is suffering a similar circumstance.
                        I pray God hears our prayers and blesses each one of use with healthy, happy pregnancies; and beautiful, healthy babies, that grow into amazing loving people.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        How many hours and how many more days?
                        These jolting emotions too much.
                        I sit here and ponder when my flower will bloom.
                        Motherhood so far from my grasp even though dreamt of since I could walk.
                        Memories of me and my dolls flash my mind and I sit there further in fret and dismay.. oh the pain! It's too much!! So I cry.
                        I then look below me and observe what I'm on and it's no flower about to bloom in the day, but a dead one who's already seen it's last one in the sun.
                        I take it as a sign and believe for a bit that all hope is gone and my womb is dead too.
                        So depressing I ponder this just can not be.
                        Then as I try to fix things myself and paint this dead thing a proper flower bud something sparks in my mind, that this is no mistake of mine.
                        The lord knew and did it on purpose.
                        This thing I sit on is the carrier of seed.
                        The future of millions of generations to come!!!
                        Given some water and nurture and love.
                        I run outside to see for myself the dead poppy outside the front door.
                        That this very bud I sit on is the one full of life!!
                        I hold it and tip it and seeds come pouring out!!
                        I realize and believe that one day I too will be a mother and with no evidence now those tiny seeds like my own will become my future 
                        and I'll look back on these days with a grin so for now I will sit here and smile above and be thankful for all the blessings to come!

                <h1>"Poppy Seeds" Painting</h1>
                <h2>May 23, 2019</h2>
                <h3>By: Noelle Perry Good</h3>

                        So amazing, So I started a painting of a woman sitting on a poppy bud and I wanted it to be symbolic of her not being in her season yet and will bloom in time.
                        But the buds not yet bloomed are all floppy and there wouldn't be room for her to sit on it without it looking funny.
                        So instead I put her on a dead poppy flower that is more up right and would have a place to sit on.
                        I was bothered that it was a "dead flower" though.
                        After I started these flower painting a friend had given me poppy flowers as a gift and I planted them in the front yard.
                        Anyway, the painting was about processing my lack of being pregnant and having kids now, I was distressed that my period has just come again and I wasn't pregnant.
                        I wanted to change it and put her on a flower that was about to bloom but while attempting to do this, holy spirit showed me something the "dead" flower she's sitting on is one with seeds in it!
                        Symbolic of the eggs in my womb. I realized this and went out to pick a dead flower to see for myself.
                        Sure enough seeds started falling out of this flower bud and they kept pouring and pouring out in abundance so the napkin was black.
                        To me this was the Lords way of saying my womb will one day be opened and I will have my children. 
                        My womb is ready this experience nearly brought me to tears and I was so thankful to God!!

                <h1>"Recieve" Painting</h1>
                <h2>May 15, 2019</h2>
                <h3>By: Noelle Perry Good</h3>
                    <p>
                        So the lord gave me a picture to paint of cascading waterfalls.
                        Shortly after this Isaac and I saw waterfalls exactly like it in my vision at Zion National Park.
                        Shortly after starting the painting about overcoming rejection god clearly spoke "recieve" what I have for you!
                        I was perplexed because he told me this so soon and I didnt hear much for the next 50+ hours of working on it.
                        The day I basically finished this painting I also won a local art contest at the mall.
                        Which I felt was God pouring out his blessing and abundance on me it was the "surround" painting that won and now is displayed at the mall!
                        At first I wanted to use the prize money on shoes I needed for my foot injury but I felt the lord wanted me to recieve so I found a cute store
                        that makes my heart happy.
                        I created this painting to serve in the processing of emotion and to help me understand what solutions were available from the Lord. 
                        He showed me all I needed to overcome was to reject what the world had given and receive in it's place what He has for me, acceptance, understanding and acknowledgment was what I needed, 
                        but is only a small bit bit of all that there is available for each of us. Receiving, however, was much easier said then done and I was at a little bit of a loss in knowing how.
                        I learned the answer symbolically as I painted. 
                        Attempting at times to paint in my own strength or knowledge resulted in "mistakes" having to be repaired. 
                        So much frustration amounted from this and I wasn't sure if I would finish it. It wasn't until I stopped and waited, literally not painting a stroke, that I was able to receive what the Lord had.
                        It was in those weeks of the painting being hidden away that the Lord gave me direction for it. 
                        He showed me the painting needed more from above, cascading light/falls, symbolic of all there is for us to receive. 
                        when I began it was surreal as though my strokes were not my own. 
                        Before there was only one waterfall the woman was receiving from and afterwords the whole painting had transformed having so many areas available. 
                        The Lord showed me that all we need to do is simply ask, wait, listen, and reach out our hands to receive.
                        I created a short YouTube slideshow/video to show some of the parts of frustration during the creation of "Receive" if you'd like to see. 
                        Notice the wings that came and went several times and some bold strokes of mist that I put in then took out.
