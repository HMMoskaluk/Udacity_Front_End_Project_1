            <h1>About the Artist</h1>
                <p>
                OfTheLight really began years ago as I started exploring my love for art as a young child.
                As a homeschool kid I had the liberty to paint for hours because of my flexible school schedule.
                I knew early on that becoming an artist was my calling.
                Later while studying art in college, a friend of mine came over and said he didn't know why, but he felt he needed to say "OfTheLight" and that was all.
                As this word brewed in my spirit it became more meaningful.
                I could see an evident need for art and for the messages in my paintings to be seen.
                Light is a central aspect of my work, often painted in the form of rays, and holds such symbolic meaning in the Kingdom of God.
                The verse,
                    <blockquote class="bibleverse">
                        <p>"For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don't belong to darkness and night."</p>
                        <footer id=bibleverse><a href="https://www.bibleref.com/1-Thessalonians/5/1-Thessalonians-5-5.html">1 Thessalonians 5:5 (NLT)</a></footer>
                    </blockquote>
                came to mind,and I knew with it's inclusive nature I needed to include more people in my practice of art; thus began the paint party extension of my business.
                One of my greatest joys is for others, especially little children, to become inspired through coming to my studio to create their own artworks.
                I believe each of us has a creative expression which is so needed in the world.
                Art serves not only as a therapeutic activity, but also a form of self expression and communication of one's conscious and unconscious mind.
                I believe awakening more of these visual voices will change the world and that is what I hope my business will help to do.
